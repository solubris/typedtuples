# typedtuples
Strongly typed tuple library for java

org.javatuples is the tuple library I have been using for years but it hasn't been updated for a long time and it fundamentally flawed.
So I am creating a new library - typedtuples

## Strong typing

The tuples never convert the Object class.

Using Objects defeats the purpose of tuples, might as well use a List or Array of objects if that's the case.
